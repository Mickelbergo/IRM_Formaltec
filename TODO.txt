1. look at different combinations of FPN/Unet/Unetplusplus/DeepLabV3 with different encoders
2. look if augmentation is good, for that look at Unet + Resnet101, which had good results before




1. incorporate yolo into the pipeline
-> it should resize the image and mask based on the predictions from our pretrained yolo network
-> then perform the other augmentations and the rest of the pipeline as usual
-> this will then also work for new images without labels
