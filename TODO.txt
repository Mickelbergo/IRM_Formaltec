also, some classes still have an iou score of 0, check why that is 


performing grid search:
calculate the original weight distribution,
then based on the original weight distribution, calculate different ranges of weights (e..g from 50-200)
gridsearch over following parameters:
-weight ranges: [(10,50), (50,200), (100,300), (10,200)]
-lambda parameters: [1,5,10,20]
-focal + CE / dice + CE [1st, 2nd]
-sampler / no sampler [yes, no]
-probabilites of yolo / no yolo
-learning rates: [0.0001, 0.0005]
-weight decay [0.01,0.001]
= 256 models that have to be trained for 50 epochs
-> takes several days


find a good way to save these parameters
