# URGENT: Additional Fix Applied

## Issue Found During Training

Your learning rate was **collapsing too fast**:
```
Epoch 1 Training: LR = 0.0000087
Epoch 1 Validation: LR = 0.0000023
```

Starting LR: 0.0002 → Dropped 99% in ONE epoch!

### Root Cause
Stage 2 and Stage 3 progressive training were missing the `scheduler_type` parameter when creating epoch runners. This meant they defaulted to the wrong scheduler behavior.

### Fix Applied
Updated lines 580 and 642 in `Main_gridsearch.py`:
```python
# BEFORE:
train_epoch_s2, valid_epoch_s2 = create_epoch_runners(
    model, CE_Loss, DICE_Loss, Focal_loss, hyperparams['lambdaa'],
    hyperparams['segmentation'], optimizer_stage2, scheduler_stage2, train_config, device
)  # Missing scheduler_type!

# AFTER:
train_epoch_s2, valid_epoch_s2 = create_epoch_runners(
    model, CE_Loss, DICE_Loss, Focal_loss, hyperparams['lambdaa'],
    hyperparams['segmentation'], optimizer_stage2, scheduler_stage2, train_config, device, 'exponential'
)  # ✅ Fixed
```

Same fix applied to Stage 3.

## Disk Space Error

The training crashed with:
```
RuntimeError: [enforce fail at inline_container.cc:783] . PytorchStreamWriter failed writing file data/103: file write failed
```

### Cause
Your dinov2-giant model is **~4.2 GB** per checkpoint. You're likely out of disk space on E:

### Solution Options

**Option 1: Disable Saving (Test Training)**
Press `Ctrl+C` during training, then press `s` + Enter to disable model saving.

**Option 2: Free Up Disk Space**
- Delete old model checkpoints in `E:/projects/Wound_Segmentation_III/Data/models/`
- Move old runs to external storage

**Option 3: Save to Different Drive**
Change config to save models on C: drive instead of E:

## What Changed

| File | Lines | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| `Epochs.py` | 10, 149, 207 | Added `scheduler_type` parameter tracking |
| `Epochs.py` | 125-134 | Fixed scheduler stepping logic |
| `Main_gridsearch.py` | 208, 334 | Return/pass `scheduler_type` |
| `Main_gridsearch.py` | 580, 642 | Pass `scheduler_type` to Stage 2/3 |
| `model.py` | 113-121 | Removed duplicate encoder unfreezing |

---

## Expected Behavior Now

With `cosine_restarts` scheduler (your current config):
- LR should smoothly cycle between 0.0002 and 1e-7
- Restarts every T_0=15 batches (after burn-in)
- Should NOT drop 99% in one epoch

---

## To Resume Training

**Recommended**: Disable model saving first to test if training works:

```bash
# Start training
python Code/training/Main_gridsearch.py

# When you see training start, press Ctrl+C
# Type: s
# Press Enter
# Type: c
# Press Enter

# Training will continue WITHOUT saving models
```

This lets you verify the LR fix without disk issues.
